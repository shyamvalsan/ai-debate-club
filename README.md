# AI Debate Club

A platform for simulating and evaluating structured debates between state-of-the-art language models.

## Overview

AI Debate Club creates a competitive environment where different language models engage in formal debates on user-provided topics. The platform facilitates structured discourse, provides objective evaluation from a panel of AI judges, and maintains ELO rankings to track performance over time.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose from a curated list of cutting-edge language models to participate in debates
- **Topic Flexibility**: Select from pre-defined debate topics or create your own
- **Standardized Format**: Debates follow established debate rules and formats
- **Blind Judging**: An impartial panel of language models evaluates debates without knowing which model produced which argument
- **User Participation**: Users can submit their own judgments before seeing the official results
- **Performance Analytics**: ELO rating system tracks and displays model performance over time

## Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Backend**: Core debate engine, model integration, and evaluation system with CLI interface
2. **Frontend**: Web interface for setting up debates, viewing results, and exploring analytics

Components can run independently, with CLI based BE-only options.
